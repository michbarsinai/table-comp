# Table Web Component

A very simple, JS only, table web component. It:

. Displays an array of objects 
. Has somewhat customizable columns
. Automatically supports sortable columns (by clicking column headers or programmatically)
. Has rows filter
. Each column can have a separate view (i.e. HTML) and sort/filter value (i.e. pure data).

NOTE: Here's a http://mbarsinai.com/projects/table-comp/[demo].
